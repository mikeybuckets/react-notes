Pass props From Component To Component
You have learned how to pass a prop to a component:

<Greeting firstName="Esmerelda" />
You have also learned how to access and display a passed-in prop:

render() {
  return <h1>{this.props.firstName}</h1>;
}
The most common use of props is to pass information to a component, from a different component. You haven’t done that yet, but it’s very similar to what you’ve seen already.

In this exercise, you will pass a prop from one component to another.

A curmudgeonly clarification about grammar:
You may have noticed some loose usage of the words prop and props. Unfortunately, this is pretty inevitable.

props is the name of the object that stores passed-in information. this.props refers to that storage object. At the same time, each piece of passed-in information is called a prop. This means that props could refer to two pieces of passed-in information, or it could refer to the object that stores those pieces of information :(

Instructions
1.
Your mission is to pass a prop to a <Greeting /> component instance, from an <App /> component instance.

If <App /> is going to pass a prop to <Greeting />, then it follows that <App /> is going to render <Greeting />.

Since <Greeting /> is going to be rendered by another component, that means that <Greeting /> needs to use an export statement.

In Greeting.js, delete this statement from line 2:

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
At the bottom of Greeting.js, remove the entire call to ReactDOM.render().

On line 3, add the word export to the beginning of the line, before the word class:

export class Greeting 


pass from
